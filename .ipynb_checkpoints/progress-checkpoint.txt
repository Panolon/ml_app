Here I write the progress of the project and ideas for further implementation.


Structure:
1. Classification
    Implemented algorithms
        1. Random Forest
        2. Support Vectors Machine
        3. KNN
        4. Naive Bayes
        5. Logistic Regression

    Metrics
        1. Precision
        2. Recall
        3. F1 score
        4. Roc auc score
        5. Classification report

    Plots
        1. Confusion Matrix
        2. Scatter plot of probabilities
        3. Precision - Recall curve
        4. ROC 
        5. Certainty histogram
            This histogram shows the differences between predicted probabilities for class 0 and class 1 in absolute values. The more closer to 1 
            the difference, the more confidence of the algorithm.


2. Clustering
    Implemented Algorithms
        1. KMeans

3. Regression

4. Dimensionality Reduction
